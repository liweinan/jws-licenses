I used `cyrus-sasl-2.1.26-32.fc27` from Koji[^1].

Here is the command to download the source code:
```
wget https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/cyrus-sasl/2.1.26/32.fc27/src/cyrus-sasl-2.1.26-32.fc27.src.rpm
```

In spec file I get the source URL:

```
# Source0 originally comes from ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/;
# make-no-dlcompatorsrp-tarball.sh removes the "dlcompat" subdirectory and b\
uilds a
# new tarball.
Source0: cyrus-sasl-%{version}-nodlcompatorsrp.tar.gz
```

I have used the source to generate `scancode` report which you can get in the `reports` directory.

The situation is complex, so I adopted the `License`[^2] info in spec file:

```
$ grep 'License:' cyrus-sasl.spec
License: BSD with advertising
```
