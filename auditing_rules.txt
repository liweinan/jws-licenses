# JWS and JBCS licenses auditing rules (Draft)

1. Find the upstream source code from its official website.

2. Run `scancode`[^1] against the downloaded source code.

3. Determine the license of the project based on the `scancode` output.

4. Store the `scancode` output into this project.

5. If there are additional proofs for a project's license, put it into this project in a per-component scope. (For example, the email discussions, the LICENSE.txt to be used, the code that proves the license to adopt, etc).
